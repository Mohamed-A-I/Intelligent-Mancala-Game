# -Intelligent-Mancala-Game.


Project Overview: The goal of this project is to implement a Mancala game along with an AI
player using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. Your game should allow a
human player to play against your algorithm. The algorithm should use a depth-first
strategy when exploring the game tree to ensure efficient memory usage.
The project can be implemented using any high-level language of your choice (C/C++, Java,
C#, python, etc.)
The game should allow either player to start first. The game can either be console based or
GUI-based (preferred but not required and not counted as a bonus feature). In case your
game does not support various difficulty levels nor a “play now” button (see bonus features
below), it should be adjusted to respond with a move in 30 seconds or less.
